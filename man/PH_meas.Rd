\title{Calculate persistent homology-based functional connectivity measures}
\usage{
PH_meas(connectivity)
}
\arguments{
\item{connectivity}{a numeric N*N matrix or data frame, of which element represents weighted connectivity between nodes. N is the number of nodes. (e.g. Pearson correlation matrix with diagonal element of 1).}
}
\value{
BS: Backbone Strength, BD: Backbone Dispersion, CS: Cycle strength, CF: Cycle frequency, aBD: adjusted Backbone Dispersion
