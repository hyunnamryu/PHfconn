#' Persistent homology-based weight sets of functional connectivity
#' @description \code{connectivity_weights_set} calculate dimension 0 (connected components) and dimension 1 (cycles) persistent homology and generate death weights of dimension 0 topological objects and birth weights of dimension 1 topological objects.
#' @param connectivity a numeric N*N matrix or data frame, of which element represents weighted connectivity between nodes. N is the number of nodes. (e.g. Pearson correlation matrix with diagonal element of 1).
#' @param na.rm logical; whether remove NA values in connectivity matrix
#'
#' @return W : a set of all weights in connectivity matrix.
#' @return WB0: a set of added weights when the number of dimension 0 (connected components) topological features decreases by 1.
#' @return WB1: a set of added weights when the number of dimension 1 (cycles) topological features increases by 1.
#' @return WB10: a set of weights making cycles until all nodes are connected. It is a subset of WB1 and complement of WB11. i.e. WB10 U WB11 = WB1.
#' @return WB11: a set of weights making cycles after all nodes are connected. It is a subset of WB1 and complement of WB10. i.e. WB10 U WB11 = WB1.
