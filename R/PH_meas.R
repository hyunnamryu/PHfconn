#' Calculate persistent homology-based functional connectivity measures
#' @description \code{PH_meas} calculate persistent homology-based functional connectivity measures
#' @param connectivity a numeric N*N matrix or data frame, of which element represents weighted connectivity between nodes. N is the number of nodes. (e.g. Pearson correlation matrix with diagonal element of 1).
#'
#' @returns BS: Backbone Strength, BD: Backbone Dispersion, CS: Cycle strength, CF: Cycle frequency, aBD: adjusted Backbone Dispersion
